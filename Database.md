# Client/Server System

For the Databases portion of the ePortfolio, I have selected a Client Server project which was coded in Python and developed within the Codio environment. This project illustrates proficiency in creating scripts using the Python language for the purpose of conducting CRUD function on a database. The Codio environment utilizes a virtual Linux operating system, and the use thereof illustrates proficiency in multiple operating systems. Additionally, the work completed for this assignment displays the ability to index and organize the information within the database for more efficient queries. This will be demonstrated using screenshot images and an informative summary essay. For these reasons, I have selected this artifact for the Database portion of the ePortfolio. 
	I have enhanced the CRUD operations for the Python scripts. The original assignment was intended to show proficiency in the subject but did not provide scripts that would be functional in a real-world scenario. This is because the scripts were developed to preform one very specific task, per project requirements. I have expanded the abilities of these scripts so that they can be utilized in a realistic manner. For the script to update the database, the original functionality only allowed the Volume key-value pair to be updated. This has been enhanced to allow the user to select any of the available key-value pair options to update. The script first asks to the Ticker ID, which is used to identify the specific data piece to be updated. Then the user is asked first for the key, and then for the updated value. When the update is performed correctly, a success message is displayed. 
	The query script has also been updated substantially. This script had three options to guide the userâ€™s query. I have enhanced this by adding three addition options. These options have been completed through the code so that they are fully functional. They allow the user to search the database based on Profit Margin (all results within a range), Country, and Company name. In addition to these enhancements, title strings have been added which will be output when the scripts are executed. The purpose of this to is provide details on what each script will do and how it should be utilized. 
	A few aspects of this project were completed using a RESTful web service. Because of how it was developed in Codio, the curl function was required to test these URIs. I have enhanced this part of the project to show better on the GitHub ePortfolio platform by creating additional scripts. These scripts are for obtaining a summary of data for a particular datapoint, and for getting a list of top results based on industry. I believe this format is better suited for the ePortfolio environment. Databases are one of the areas where I have limited experience. My courses at SNHU which discuss this topic have been limited. I am proud of my work with the scripts and with the functionality they contain. This time spent reworking and enhancing this project has helped to reinforce what I have learned in previous courses concerning database management and manipulation.
